## 🚀 About the Game

**El Impostor** is a game of words and suspicions. A group of **Civilians** knows a **Secret Word**, but hidden among them are one or more **Impostors** who have no idea what it is. 🤫

### 🎯 The Objective
- **Civilians:** Identify and eliminate all Impostors before they figure out the secret word.
- **Impostors:** Blend in, confuse the civilians, and guess the secret word if they are caught.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Local Play:** You only need one phone to play with all your friends. 📲
- **Dynamic Roles:** Automatic role assignment (Civilians and Impostors). 🎭
- **Various Themes:** Different word categories to keep the game fresh. 📂
- **Modern Interface:** Sleek, dark design that's easy to use, built with React Native and TailwindCSS. 💅
- **Haptics & Animations:** An immersive tactile experience. ⚡

## 🎮 How to Play

1. **Setup:** Choose the number of players and the number of impostors. 👥
2. **Reveal:** Pass the phone around. Each player must press to reveal their role and the secret word (if they are a civilian). 👁️
3. **The Round:** Each player says a single word related to the secret word. Be careful! If you're too obvious, the impostor will guess it. If you're too vague, they'll suspect you. 🗣️
4. **Discussion & Voting:** Debate who you think the impostor is and vote to eliminate them. 🗳️
5. **Victory:**
    - **Civilians** win if they eliminate all impostors. 🏆
    - **Impostors** win if they equal the number of civilians or if they guess the word correctly upon being discovered. 😈
